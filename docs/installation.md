# Installation


To install Tikz-Python, run
```
pip install tikz-python
```
In order to compile your drawings, you need an installation of `LaTeX`, with PDF and TikZ libraries and latexmk. Unless you decided to customize your LaTeX installation, all of these should already be on your system. 

If you don't have these on your system, you can of course still use Tikz-Python to generate Tikz code, which you can then take to another system with LaTeX installed to compile on.
