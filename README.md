This is a TikZ-Python, a python module that allows one to very simply and intuitively create complex figures in TikZ. 

## Why
This is for people who know basic Python and TikZ, but who have realized that while TikZ is amazing, it is really annoying to use. (It's not TikZ's fault; since TikZ was implemented in TeX, a 1980s markup language written in an outdated literate programming language/obfuscated, incompilable "Pascal-H", it is only unnecessarily difficult and inconvenient to use because TeX was never made to be a programming language.)

I've looked at other python-tikz mashups, and they are generally not very simple and do not have examples on how to use.
